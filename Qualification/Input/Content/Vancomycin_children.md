### Vancomycin model

Vancomycin PBPK predictions in children were evaluated using pharmacokinetic (PK) data reported in the following studies: 

- Schaad UB, McCracken GH Jr, Nelson JD. Clinical pharmacology and efficacy of vancomycin in pediatric patients. J Pediatr. 1980 Jan;96(1):119-26.[[Schaad 1980](#3-references)]

The pediatric PBPK model predicted the clearance values of vancomycin observed in pediatric studies reasonably across all available age groups, ranging from 0.085 months to 7.58 years old. The ratios of mean predicted over observed clearance values are illustrated in the table below as well as in the predicted versus observed clearance ratio plot, showing that all predictions in children were within 2-fold error of observed values.
