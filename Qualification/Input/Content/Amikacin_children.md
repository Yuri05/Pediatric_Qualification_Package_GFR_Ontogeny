### Amikacin model

Amikacin PBPK predictions in children were evaluated using pharmacokinetic (PK) data reported in the following studies: 

- Tréluyer JM, Merlé Y, Tonnelier S, Rey E, Pons G. Nonparametric population pharmacokinetic analysis of amikacin in neonates, infants, and children. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2002 May;46(5):1381-7.[[Tréluyer 2002](#3-references)]
- Vogelstein B, Kowarski A, Lietman PS. The pharmacokinetics of amikacin in children. J Pediatr. 1977 Aug;91(2):333-9.[Vogelstein 1977](#3-references)]
- Belfayol L, Talon P, Eveillard M, Alet P, Fauvelle F. Pharmacokinetics of once-daily amikacin in pediatric patients. Clin Microbiol Infect. 1996 Feb;2(3):186-191.[[Belfayol 1996](#3-references)]

The pediatric PBPK model reasonably well predicted the clearance values of amikacin  pediatric studies across all available age groups, ranging from 0.16 months to 16 years old. The ratios of mean predicted over observed clearance values are illustrated in the table below as well as in the predicted versus observed clearance ratio plot, showing that all predictions in children were within 2-fold error of observed values.
