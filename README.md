# Pediatric Qualification Package for GFR Ontogeny

In this repository the electronic package for qualification of GFR ontogeny using in vivo probe substances is stored, including a **qualification plan** (*qualification_plan.json*) including references to respective model snapshots and static content (e.g. text blocks, *.md files) to produce a **qualification report**.

The following probe substances were included:

- Amikacin [[1](#references)]
- Vancomycin [[2](#references)]

The latest release of the qualification plan and the static content can be found [here](../../releases/latest).

**The latest release of the qualification report can be found [here](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSP-Qualification-Reports/releases/latest).**
